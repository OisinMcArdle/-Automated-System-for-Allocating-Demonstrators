Difficulty: *
Given a fixed amount of resources, one needs to distribute the resources in an optimized way such that everyone is happy.  For example, assigning a number of demonstrators to different lab sessions while preserve conflict-free property.  One must make sure that there is no clash between demonstratorâ€™s time table and lab sessions.  Furthermore, the system also allows users to rank individual demonstrators based on different ranking criteria. This project targets the similar problem that the department encountered recent years, that is, the demonstrator allocation problem.  It aims to solve this problem once for all. Note that this project aims to work on a relaively small scale of the problem rather than solving a large optimisation problem.
